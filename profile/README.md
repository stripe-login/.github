# STRIPE LOGIN GLOBAL ISSUES

## Overview
Stripe is a comprehensive financial technology platform providing businesses with payment processing tools, financial management, and other financial services globally. However, users may encounter various login issues, including geographical restrictions that limit access in certain countries.

## Common Login Issues

### Technical Issues
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Problems**
  - Inability to complete the verification process
  - Lost access to verification device
  - Solution: Temporarily disable 2FA via dashboard.stripe.com/recover or use backup codes

- **Password Problems**
  - Forgotten passwords
  - Solution: Reset password via email confirmation

- **Account Ownership Issues**
  - Non-account owners need administrator assistance to reset 2FA or password

- **Mobile App-Specific Issues**
  - Outdated app versions
  - Device compatibility problems
  - Support Specialist roles cannot log in (insufficient permissions)
  - Only Standard accounts can use the mobile app (not Custom or Express accounts)

- **CAPTCHA Errors**
  - Solutions:
    - Disable VPNs or browser extensions blocking hCaptcha
    - Try private browsing or a different browser
    - Ensure network allows access to hcaptcha.com and subdomains
    - Check corporate firewall settings
